1. Data structure is a group of elements that are used to organise, process, and retrieve data in an efficent manner.
2. It is of two types: linear(array, stack, queue, linked list) and non-linear(trees, graphs).
3. We can perform lot of useful operations on DS such as traversing, insertion, deletion, updation, sorting, etc.,
4. DS helps to access data and use the memory of the computer efficently.
5. Python has two types of DS: built-in(list, dictionary, tuple, set) and user-defined(stack, queue, tree, linked list, graph, hasmap)
