Hi Mam, what I learned about Git is, 
1. It is a tool that helps developers to manage their source code.
2. It is a distributed version control software meaning with we can collaborate with other developers in real-time and develop products. 
3. It offers a variety of controls over our code such as add, commit with a comment, and track the history of our code.
4. We can also see the status of our repository which tells whether we need to commit, and is there are any staged or unstaged changes on our repo.
5. It is a useful tool for teams who are working remotely. 

These are things I have learned about Git.
